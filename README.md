<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Ruby is an existing platform that helps teachers manage classes and assessments by generating Teacher Planning, School Reporting, and Credentialing assessments using multiple-choice questions. The client presented three challenges, and we provided solutions:

1. **How to ensure that teachers understand each topic in the same way for very different contexts?** We standardized module weight allocations to ensure teachers understand the importance and focus of each module, leading to a consistent understanding and assessment criteria.
2. **How to know what evidence the teacher uses to judge each student's ability?** We established a feedback loop involving students and multiple levels of evaluators. This allows teachers to reflect on their assessment methods and align them with standardized criteria, ensuring clear understanding and use of evidence.
3. **How to check the difference of ability level between different disciplines?** By comparing weight allocations across different courses by various teachers, we can analyze how different disciplines prioritize various skills and knowledge areas. This comparison helps us evaluate the differences in ability levels across disciplines in a detailed manner.

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
## Acknowledgments
The Ruby Platform is the exclusive intellectual property of the University of Melbourne. We hereby extend our gratitude to them for providing the foundational knowledge to help build our infrastructure on. Without their explicit support and allocation of resources, the realisation of this project would not have been feasible.

Moreover, we wish to formally acknowledge the invaluable contributions made by all team members involved in the development of the Ruby platform thus far. Their sustained dedication, expert proficiency, and collaborative ethos have been indispensable in moulding this innovative solution.
